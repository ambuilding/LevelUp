## Speller

## Implement a spell-checker, report the number of words misspelled/ dictionary/ text, and the time.

0. Dictionary is assumed to be a file containing a list of lowercase words, one per line and text is a file to be spell-checked. As the brackets suggest, provision of dictionary is optional; if this argument is omitted, speller will use WORDS by default.

1. Even if foo is in dictionary, check should return false given foo's if foo's not in dictionary.
